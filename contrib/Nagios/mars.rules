# For each variable $Var (as documented in "mars_check.sh --help"), the following relatives are always defined:
#
# $LastVar           the old value from the last run of mars_check.sh (whenever it was called; recommendation: 5 minutes)
# $DeltaLastVar      the difference between $Var and $LastVar
# $RateLastVar       the $DeltaLastVar normalized to the elapsed time (unit: per minutes)
#
# $MediumVar         the old value from a medium-term run of mars_check.sh ($window_medium, default 3600s)
# $DeltaMediumVar    the difference between $Var and $MediumVar
# $RateMediumVar     the $DeltaMediumVar normalized to the elapsed time (unit: per minutes)
#
# $LongtermVar       the old value from a longterm run of mars_check.sh ($window_longterm, default 24h)
# $DeltaLongtermVar  the difference between $Var and $LongtermVar
# $RateLongtermVar   the $DeltaLongtermVar normalized to the elapsed time (unit: per minutes)


# The first number in each line is the priority class.
# Lower number = higher priority = takes precence over higher class numbers
# Exception: 0 means that the check will appear unconditionally (class is irrelevant)
#
# Hint: checks can be simply disabled by commenting them out
