Main responsible developer: Thomas Schoebel-Theuer (tst@1und1.de)

Testsuite: developed by Frank Liepold. Many thanks to him!

Some scripts / testing / docs are from Joerg Mann (freelancer at 1&1)
and from Ulrich Goettlich / Ingvar Gilbert / Daniel Herrmann (sysadmins).

Further thanks go to many people inside 1&1 who protected and promoted
MARS, influenced my goals and strategies, and gave me the time to do it.
