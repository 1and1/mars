The patches in this directory have to be applied to the
pristine kernel sources, _before_ MARS can be compiled.

The main reason is that MARS needs some additional EXPORT_SYMBOL
statements not present in most kernels.

Therefore the pre-patches are rather simple and lightweight.

Usage:

cd /path/to/your/kernel/source
patch -p1 < /path/to/according/pre-patch.patch
cd block/
git clone git://url/to/mars.git
# (or another way of putting the mars sources into block/ )

# afterwards, configure and compile your kernel as usual, e.g.
cd .. # goto root of the kernel sources again
make oldconfig
make
# ... and so on
