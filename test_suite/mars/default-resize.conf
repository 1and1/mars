## defaults for module resize

## size in G to add physically to data device (lvresize)
resize_size_to_add=3

## difference in G to resize_size_to_add which will be added via marsadm resize
## e.g. actual: phsyical size = marsadm size = 5 G
##              new (with resize_size_to_add=2 and resize_diff_to_phsyical=1):
##              physical size = 7 G, marsadm size = 6 G
resize_diff_to_phsyical=1

## time for which the amount of data to replay must be constant to declare
## the replay process as having stopped
resize_time_constant_replay=5

## time for which the amount of data to fetch must be constant to declare
## the fetch process as having stopped
resize_time_constant_fetch=10

## time for which the amount of data to sync must be constant
## to declare the sync process as inactive
resize_time_constant_sync=5

## maxtime to wait for replay to stop (after pause-replay)
resize_maxtime_replay=60

## maxtime to wait for fetch to stop (after pause-fetch)
resize_maxtime_fetch=600

## maxtime to wait for sync to stop
